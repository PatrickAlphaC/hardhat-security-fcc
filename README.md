# Update: Head to Cyfrin Updraft

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Important:** This repo is no longer maintained; we invite all people learning Solidity to head to [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)! The 100% free #1 smart contract education platform on earth. Developed with love by Patrick & Cyfrin <3

# Hardhat Security

This is a section of the Javascript Blockchain/Smart Contract FreeCodeCamp Course. This part of the course is to help users understand basic security and some fundamentals of auditing.

This repo has a few contracts with big flaws, see if you can see them, and see if the tools help you find them!

*This repo has been updated for Sepolia over Goerli.*

# What is an Audit?

An audit is a security focused code review for looking for issues with your code. 

# Help your auditors!

When writing good code, you 100% need to follow these before sending you code to an audit.

[Tweet from legendary security expert Tincho](https://twitter.com/tinchoabbate/status/1400170232904400897)

-   Add comments
    -   This will help your auditors understand what you're doing.
-   Use [natspec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/natspec-format.html)
    -   Document your functions. DOCUMENT YOUR FUNCTIONS.
-   Test
    -   If you don't have tests, and test coverage of all your functions and lines of code, you shouldn't go to audit. If your tests don't pass, don't go to audit.
-   Be ready to talk to your auditors
    -   The more communication, the better.
-   Be prepared to give them plenty of time.
    -   They literally pour themselves over your code.

> "At this time, there are 0 good auditors that can get you an audit in under a week. If an auditor says they can do it in that time frame, they are either doing you a favor or they are shit. " - Patrick Collins, March 4th, 2022

# Process

An auditors process looks like this:

1. Run tests
2. Read specs/docs
3. Run fast tools (like slither, linters, static analysis, etc)
4. Manual Analysis
5. Run slow tools (like echidna, manticore, symbolic execution, MythX)
6. Discuss (and repeat steps as needed)
7. Write report ([Example report](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/tree/main/audits))

Typically, you organize reports in a chart that looks like this:

# Getting Started

## Requirements

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    -   You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
        -   `node --version` and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
-   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
        -   `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
        -   You might need to install it with npm
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    -   You'll know you've installed docker right if you can run:
    -   `docker --version` and get an ouput like `Docker version xx.xx.xx, build xxxxx`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-security-fcc
cd hardhat-security-fcc
yarn set version 1.22.19   # can skip if your default version is already 1.x.x
yarn
```

(Yarn version 1 is recommended because auto-migration of this repo to yarn v2 doesn't go well. If your node version is incompatible with this, try node 16.19.1.)
Then, go right into [usage](#usage)

## No Typescript Support

Sorry! Feel free to make a PR if you'd like to see typescript here. 

### Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the `clone this repo` part.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-security-fcc)


# Usage

## Slither
